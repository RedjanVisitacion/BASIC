    <p class="letters">Ipsum" is a Latin word meaning "himself, herself, itself." It's often used in the phrase "lorem ipsum," which is a placeholder text used in graphic design, publishing, and web development. This dummy text is used to fill spaces and preview the layout of a design before the final content is added. </p>
